# Chroma

### Awarded the Graphcore prize for best 3rd Year Computer Science Group Project

Chroma is a virtual reality puzzle game incorporating drawing in 3 dimensional space as a key puzzle solving component. It does this by providing each drawing with a particular physical property based on it’s colour, which must be taken into consideration in order to solve the puzzles. The plot of the game positions the player as an archeologist on a journey deep in the jungle, whereupon they find themselves trapped inside an ancient temple after discovering two mystical wands with the mysterious ability of drawing physical structures in thin air. With no way back the only way to escape is forward through the various puzzles that lay ahead.
